# :exclamation: Looking for new contributors :exclamation:
As you may have noticed, this package has not been updated for some time. 

However, as of April 2025 some changes area afoot to recover all the bulma-extensions formerly coded by wikiki, to a useful state.
If you are interested in bieng part of a group that maintains these compoments, please leave an Issue in the project you're most interested in, to that effect.

In the meantime, consider the use of one available alternative:
- [Bulma Steps by aramvisser](https://github.com/aramvisser/bulma-steps).
- [Bulma O Step by octoshrimpy](https://octoshrimpy.github.io/bulma-o-steps/)

If you're intersted in taking it over and maintain it, please contact me at wikiki@protonmail.com to discuss how to proceed.
